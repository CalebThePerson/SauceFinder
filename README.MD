# SauceFinder

Ever wonder what's the name of a certain Doujin panel?  Or how about wanting to find multiple Doujinshis

with there tags but you are too lazy to type each one out and look at the name?  Well

this is just for you.  SauceFinder is a Doujinshi and (soon to be) hentai reverse search app.  Allows you

to simply find Doujinshi and Hentai straight from your phone with ease.

  

  

## Features

  

- Uses Nhentai API to find the details of any Doujinshi

- Uses SauceNao API, to find information on a screenshot of a Doujinshi

- Utilizes Text Recognition, to detect multiple sauce digits in a photo

- Soon to work with hentai

  

## Installation

  

Currently there is no IPA for the project.  However you can download the entire project and sideload it onto your phone through Xcode.

  

1. Fork the Repo or download the project to your computer

2. Open up a terminal within the directory of the project

3. After opening the termanal run the command `pod install` and let that run

- Notice: In order to run the following command you must have Cocoapods installed on your computer

if you do note have it installed please run `sudo gem install cocoapods`

4. Congrats you (hopefully) should be done and can now open the `.xcworkspace` file that has been created within the directory
